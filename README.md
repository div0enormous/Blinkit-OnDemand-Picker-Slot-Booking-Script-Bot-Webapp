# ⚡ Blinkit OD Slot Automation Tool

## 👤 Developer Introduction

I’m an anonymous developer currently working as a Blinkit On-Demand Picker. Alongside my store work, I’ve been studying programming and automation systems out of curiosity — mainly to understand how real-world apps and workflows behave under performance constraints.

During daily operations, I repeatedly ran into one practical issue: **slot booking speed**.

The Store Ops app often performs slowly on low-CPU devices, and available slots are usually claimed within seconds. Manual booking became unreliable, especially during peak release times. Missing slots directly meant missing work opportunities.

Instead of treating it as a complaint, I treated it as a technical problem to solve.

This project started as a small experiment and evolved into a working automation script and web interface. Building it required studying request timing, workflow behavior, retry logic, and automation control patterns. The implementation was significantly more complex than expected and went through multiple iterations before reaching a stable state.

After controlled testing in my local environment, the tool proved effective for automated slot detection and booking — removing the need for constant manual app interaction and reducing timing delays.
